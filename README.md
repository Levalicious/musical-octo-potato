# Edit #

Wow. This repo, and this project are pretty old and seriously out of date. Since making this, I've stopped using Ethereum's ECKey system and migrated to an implementation of Pieter Wuille's EC-Schnorr specification (with some modifications). I've also decided against dPoS and a lot of other things. I've also started researching my own consensus/governance solution ideas, so basically I'm just keeping this repository as something to look back on with fond nostalgia at times. Maybe someday I'll completely rewrite it, but this project will also be on the backburner, like many of my other ones, until my p2p networking is more mature.
